# 🐳 Docker Compose: .NET API + SQL Server Starter

A complete beginner-friendly template to run a containerized `.NET Web API` and `SQL Server` using **Docker Compose**.

🎓 This project is designed as a learning resource for students, educators, and developers who want to:
- Understand how Docker works with .NET and SQL Server
- Set up a local dev environment with containerized services
- Explore how APIs communicate with databases in a real-world dev setup

## 📦 Project Overview

This repo includes:
- A minimal `.NET 8 Web API` with one controller
- A `docker-compose.yml` file to run SQL Server in a container
- A `Dockerfile` to containerize the API
- Sample database connection setup
- Instructions for running and testing locally

## 🧱 Tech Stack

| Layer          | Tech                 |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Backend API    | ASP.NET Core (.NET 8)|
| Database       | SQL Server (Linux image) |
| Containerization | Docker, Docker Compose |
| Environment    | Localhost (dev-ready) |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
```

### 2. Build & Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:
- Build the .NET API container
- Pull the official SQL Server image
- Set up networking between containers

### 3. Test the API

Visit:  
`http://localhost:5000/weatherforecast`

> You'll get a default response from the API.  
Database connection is configured in `appsettings.Development.json`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 🔑 SQL Server Settings

Environment variables for SQL Server are defined in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
SA_PASSWORD: "Your_password123"
ACCEPT_EULA: "Y"
```

Update the connection string in the `.NET API` accordingly:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=sqlserver,1433;Database=MyAppDb;User=sa;Password=Your_password123;"
}
```
